Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

      The driver pass system was created to help with students to pass their drivers test at the DMV, as little on the road training is conducted. The system would allow for students to create an account and schedule a reservation with an instructor to drive with. The instructor could leave personalized notes so the student knows what they need to work on, as well as allow students to take online practice tests.

What did you do particularly well?
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

      Creating the basis for the system and designing how it will flow was done exceedingly well. The design process allows the designers to plan out how the system should flow through various UML diagrams and what the final product hopes to achieve. I would revise the business requirements portion and focus on gathering more customer requirements and getting detailed information. This will prevent the system from being developed with using guesswork. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

    Gathering requirements is one of the major tasks of the SDLC, as it gives designers input on what the customer is needing from the software. Without using the customer's requirements, the system will not fit with their needs, and would not align with their standards.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

      Designing software using different UML diagrams, such as activity or class diagrams help in keeping the development process simple. To begin the designing process, gather good and detailed user requirements, and use these to shape the systems overall flow. Create diagrams that include every bit of info of what each class will need to function based on the requirements, and work through each activity of the system, until every feature is planned and designed.
